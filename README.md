AP Comp Sci Final Project

This project is a game that involves units battling to reach either side of the screen. You will lose if an enemy unit reaches the far
right side of the screen. Controls are shown when the game is loaded, and a variety of both friendly and enemy units are implemented.

The game is locked at a framerate of 40 FPS

Run Main.main to start playing the game, and use [ESC] to exit when you are done playing.

Have fun!
